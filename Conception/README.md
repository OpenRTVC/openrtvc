This folder contains all the theoretical design of Open RTVC project. I thank my Physics Professor for his help by correcting some mathematical errors and giving me some advices to do this project. I work on this project with an another student and we have worked together to solve mechanical dynamic problem about rocket motor inclinaison and servo motor angle. I thank his Professor too for his help.
